# EHR Temporal Embedding for Infection Risk Prediction in Asplenia
The software and data in this repository is part of an ongoing activity aiming at
developing a computational pipeline for the prediction of risk of severe infections due to compromised immune function for asplenic patients. 
In this study the infection risk prediction capability of a gradient boosting machine relying on ML embedding techniques for representing temporal causal dependences in clinical data from Electronic Health Records is assessed. 

Demonstration code of paper: Learning Infection Risk in Asplenia from Structured and Time-Series Clinical Records, submitted to 
IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.
